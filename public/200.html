          <p>One of the things I liked most about having attended The Iron Yard was the networking. I built so many great relationships
            between instructors, classmates and the community. Thank you, Toni, for making the students and alumni your number
            one priority. You did such an amazing job at being supportive and building a TIY "family". Thank you, Jason,
            for not only being a wonderful instructor, but also for laughing and crying with us. We all had some tough times
            during that cohort and it was nice that we could all be there for one another.</p>
          <p>Because I live in Sarasota I didn't get up to TIY for meetups and social events as much as I would've liked. However,
            there was great comfort in knowing it was there. Thanks to TIY for having provided a fun and encouraging environment
            for the community.</p>

          <p>It started with a what if. It started from a maybe. I’d seen people’s dream come true, and I lived with someone who was working on his dreams, someone whom was able to work on them thanks to The Iron Yard. The stories were hysterical and amazing, but I didn’t really think I would be able to do it. Then I met Holly, and we talked about all the different people who came in, and how I would be a great. Then I talked to Toni, and saw the passion. So I took a leap.</p>
          <p>Then I lost my mind, and Katherine saved me from myself, showing me the ways of the CSS master, and being a support when I needed one. I knew it would be hard, but Mark, Gavin, and Jason worked hard to make sure that we got all that we could- and tried to be careful and guiding when they saw the overload happening. </p>
          <p>I owe everything to the staff of the Iron Yard St. Pete. What Mark has taught me has been amazing, and a rollercoaster of awesome and joy. I’m so grateful for all the time they gave me, and I’m thankful for the opportunity given to me; it will make my life so much better.</p>

            the hardest things I’ve done in my life but one of the most gratifying. The lessons I learned at The Iron Yard

          <p>My family and I want to thank you all for being patient with me as I went through The Iron Yard. Thank you, Katherine
            and Holly, for the career support advice, answering all my stupid questions and having the ability to always
            put a smile on my face. Thank you, Angel for the sound advice and letting me drown you in D&amp;D. Thank you
            Toni for tirelessly working behind scenes with the community to ensure they our hard work is seen and appreciated.
            Thank you, Mark and Jason, for providing me with the proper guidance when I needed your help. Thank you, Gavin,
            for always pushing me to be a better developer, teaching me how to seek and find the answers when I was stuck
            on a problem and your patience for when I was at the ragged edge. Thank you for showing all of us that has walk

          <p>The Iron Yard was one of the most intimidating, exhausting, and stressful challenges I have ever taken on and I
            would not change my decision to attend for anything. The Iron Yard has granted me the opportunity to meet so
            many fantastic people and make an amazing group of friends. The Iron Yard gave me a home away from home, it became
            a sanctuary where people of similar mind would share ideas and learn from eachother, strengthening their bonds
            through a common goal.</p>
          <p>Thank you Toni, Holly, Katherine, Mark, Jason, Gavin and Angel. Each and every one of you in your own way contributed

          <p>I will not lie. TIY was hard.... really hard. Initially I thought of it as an answer, but like so many things in
            life, it just brought up more questions and turned out to be the beginning of another long path. <strong>Fortunately, I really enjoy the path that I'm on!!!</strong></p>
          <p>Thank you Toni, Holly, Katherine, Jason, Gavin, Mark and Angel for helping me get off to a good start. I could
            not have chosen a finer group of people to have done it with. I am so grateful for each and every one of you

          <p>All of the stafff at the Iron Yard is/was fantastic but during my time in cohort3, it was just Jason and Toni.
            SO, I want to say a big thank you to both of you for your support during and WELL after my time at Iron Yard.
            I would love the opportunity to attempt to help you as much as you have helped me.</p>

          <p>My biggest reason to attend TIY was to change my career path, but in the end a new career is just a small portion
            of all that I gained. Meeting a whole new set of friends and colleagues who deeply support and care about each
            other doesn’t happen that often. 12 weeks at Iron Yard was not easy, but I had so much fun, and I felt so much
            at home feeding off of everyone’s passion and enthusiasm that it felt like I was back at college working on my
            senior thesis animation, which was one of the happiest times of my life.</p>
          <p>Thank you Toni for your ever so positive attitude, hard work, support, loving heart and magically effective letters
            of recommendation you wrote on my behalf. You are AMAZING in every way. Thank you Katherine for everything, especially
            your friendship and empathy. Coming from a former TIY grad, it really meant a lot. Holly, you are simply delightful!!
            Thank you for being such a great cheerleader to us all! Angel thank you for always make me feel so welcome to
            come back to TIY. I love how you evolved from student to instructor. Like I said before, I can see my son in
            you in 20 years. </p>
          <p>Thank you Jason for your guidance when I reached out to you just before I had one of job interviews (which saved
            me from a melt down,) and your caring heart. It’s so warming to know how much you truly care about people, students,
            and Totoro. Thank you Mark. Even though you made me feel shockingly old by not being able to share my memories
            of when Google first came out, you have always proven capable of teaching and guiding.</p>
          <p>And Gavin, I don’t even know where to start to thank you for always being there from answering questions, sharing
            knowledge, stories, giving advice, and having the patience of a saint! Your sincere heartfelt encouragement helped
            me get through some rough moments in this journey. So, Thank you. </p>

The Ocho's definitely will be part of one of the best chapters of the book of life, we became brothers and sisters since the beggining, with ups and downs, the ping-pong, the knights, the darts, the games, the Iron Socials, we all were there for each other. This trip would not be the same without The Iron Yard householders all of you, this was amazing Toni, Gavinho (his ability to code like a brazilian football star blew my mind), Mark, Jason, Angel, Hollywood and Katherine Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Coming to TIY qualifies as one of the scariest decisions I have ever made in my life. Yet, from the first time
            I stepped on campus it just felt like the right place to be. The environment that Toni, Katherine, Holly, Angel,
            Gavin, Mark and Jason created was one of support, encouragement, and an unwavering belief that I could do this
            – despite my own doubts. </p>
          <p>There really are no words that can accurately convey the experience of learning from Gavin, Mark and Jason. I’ve
            lost count of the times I have sat in awe and completely mesmerized watching each of you work. True masters of
            your craft. I can only imagine it is similar to having been in the presence of artists such as van Gogh, da Vinci
            and Dali – I’ll let you figure out who is who. </p>
          <p>It was an honor and a pleasure to have spent the past three months with ‘you all’ and my hope, going forward, is

          <p>Going through school I was constantly frustrated trying to find a career that both I was good at and enjoyed. I found myself always caught in between creative and analytical skills that didn’t quite have a home in one industry. Due to this feeling of feeling like the jack of all trades but not quite ‘belonging’ to one field of study I will never forget the first time I got my hands dirty writing some code. The idea of creating, and improving technology that enhanced my life on a daily basis was so thrilling, but also overwhelming.</p>
          <p>I could have not imagined a better place to grow my new skills. The Iron Yard - St. Petersburg was by far one of the most rigorous, and supportive environments I have ever experienced. I can honestly say that I would not be the same person without technology, nor would I be the same developer without The Iron Yard. Going into The Iron Yard I could put together a simple website using HTML and CSS. Three months later I can make site mockups, fully responsive websites, make an API using ExpressJS, and build a dynamic front end in React. I have never felt so empowered in just three months. It is a real change of perspective to think that I can make anything I can imagine with time being the only boundary to my success.</p>
          <p>There is absolutely no substitute for this program, community, or The Iron Yard staff. I know The Iron Yard closing has been hard on all the staff and student, but I think in the long run it will be all for the best. I am excited to see what the future has to offer for our community, and all the new opportunities for growth. This program changed my life forever, and I would have not learned as much as I have without The Iron Yard.</p>

          <p>I can't even explain how much The Iron Yard means to me, let alone how you all changed my life for the better.
            I was struggling trying to figure out what I wanted to do post-masters, when Michael told me "why don't you try
            coding." I laughed at him and dismissed it because I didn't think that was something I could do. I also didn't
            want to do anything related to math or science because that was too close to what my parents did. You all made
            me realize that being a programmer isn't just math and science, and I won't turn into my parents by going into
          </p>
          <p>Angel, thank you for always being "HERE!!!!" Even if you are the WORST person to play Secret Hitler with. Holly,
            you're smile and energy made those days I was struggling easier. Katherine, you've been a sounding board for
            me and a great friend. Thank you for encouraging me to do the kid's classes. Mark, I'll always remember when
            we were trying to install bootcamp and Windows on my mac. At one point, I asked why it wasn't working and you
            said "I don't know. Why isn't it working?" That's when I realized even really awesome programmers don't know
            what's going on a lot of the time. Gavin, you have been a life saver helping answer my on-the-job ruby questions.
            No matter how stupid my questions were, you never made me feel stupid. Jason, thank you for pushing me and reassuring
            me. Thank you for letting me cry to you, and thank you for your continued support after. It really means a lot
            to me. Finally, Toni, thank you for being everyone's number one cheerleader and life coach. I also need to thank
            you for letting me cry to you as well and for all your reassurance. Your check ins and talks helped me keep my

            part of all our lives.</p>

          <p>I am so incredibly fortunate to say I went to The Iron Yard. It was the thing that helped me reach goals I'd been working on for almost 3 years prior.</p>
          <p>Thank you to all of the staff. My life has improved because of you. When imposter syndrome held me back, your constant encouragement and positivity was exactly what I needed. I wish you all the best and hope to know you for a long time to come.</p>

          <p>My experience at the Iron Yard was extremely challenging but don’t get me wrong, I’m still learning and will continue. The best thing I found besides coding was the immense support and understanding that this team gave us.</p>
          <p>I just want to say, <strong>T H A N K  Y O U !</strong></p>
          <p>From the beginning until the end, everyone was extremely patient and helpful. From my first contact with Holly, who took so much time and was so kind to help me through the entire process. Also a special thanks to Gavin because he put up with my endless questions, never gave up on any of us, was and is an incredible mentor and teacher, and was always willing to help just like everyone else. I turned to every teacher and received more than I could ask for.</p>
          <p>To the entire staff; Toni, Katherine, Holly, Gavin, Jason, Mark, and Angel - thank you for all your effort, time, and support. I couldn’t have done it without you!</p>

          <p>Making a complete career shift into programming has been such an important transition in my life that I can only be thankful and grateful that everyone at The Iron Yard Tampa/St. Pete has made it so smooth and wonderful. Not only has the Iron Yard taught me so much but it has also facilitated a comfortable environment that has allowed me to meet new people and make so many new friends. It's been pretty awesome being around others that are pursuing the same career goals and to be inspired by them and those above us.</p>
          <p>Thank you Toni, Holly, Katherine, Mark, Gavin, Jason and Angel. It's been a pleasure getting to know each one of you and I'm sure that we'll be seeing each other in times to come, but I'm excited to see where you all end up! I'm sure you will continue to do great things along the way. Thank you for being so strong in the midst of so much going around you guys, I was very encouraged to see you all come together and keep pushing foward towards your goals! I hope you can continue to change many other lives in the future as well! Again, it was a great pleasure being around you guys and for introducing me into the Tech World!</p>

          <p>Thank You. Thank You. Thank You. From day one it felt like one huge, diverse and happy family. In all our nerdy
            gloriousness.. we came, we coded, and we conquered iron pints. From sharing our highs and lows to the open minds
            and hearts of our instructors who were always willing to give every bit of their time to ensuring our success (
            looking at you Jason.. and the Caleb/Bru/Dan GraphQL adventures) - The Iron Yard will live on through each and
            every one of us. "And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same."
          </p>
          <p>Thank you Jason, Gavin, Toni, Mark, Holly and Katherine! For inspiring and empowering Cohort 6 to enter the
            coding world and share our gift with others. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors! Made with <span>

          <p>After grad school I spent a long time not knowing what I was going to do with my life, and Iron Yard helped me
            find something like a calling. For that I will be forever greatful. TIY was the throbbing heart of the Tampa
            Bay tech community, and though I am sad to see it leave the scene I am confident that something will take its
            place.

          <p>I cannot thank the instructors and staff at The Iron Yard enough for all thier help and support during my journey.
            It was one of the hardest mental challenges I have had to endure but I'm proud to say I was a part of The Ocho.
            The skills and logic skills I have gained are going to help all of us no matter what paths we end up taking.
            We are all very fortunate to have the staff that we had supporting us. You all didn't quit in providing us the
            support we needed and that is something we are all thankful for.</p>
          <p>Mark, Gavin, Jason, Angel, Holly, Katherine and Toni you all are the dream team of code education. I am excited
            to see what you all put together as the next "iteration" of the Iron Yard. It will only get better from here.
            Thanks for everything and for as much as you have supported us you know that you all have an army of students
            who are ready to help support you all as well. Once again, Thank You! You have helped create better lives for
            many and that is truly something to be proud of.

          <p>Every once in a while in my life, I've gotten this funny feeling, a little tug in the pit of my stomach that tells
            me, "pay attention, something important is happening". It doesn't happen often and it always takes me by surprise
            when it does. I got that feeling the first time I walked into The Iron Yard. I knew what it meant and I decided
            right there to savor every moment of the following 12 weeks.</p>
          <p>I remember it all vividly. Early morning drives to St. Pete from Spring Hill and the long walk down 1st Street
            in the dark. Toni flipping on the lights and blinding me every morning as I sat working in the dark. The inevitable
            flood every time it rained and the horrible stench when they re-did the floors in the space below. Long walks
            at lunch to blow off steam and the first tentative steps in a friendship that would come to be so important in
            my life.</p>
          <p>Coding? Yeah, I learned a lot about javascript and working with git, but that isn't what I think about when I remember
            my time at TIY. I think mostly on the things I learned about myself and the amazing people that touched my life.
            I can't imagine how empty my life would be without them.</p>

          <p>I came to The Iron Yard with zero programming background whatsoever. After over a decade in finance, a layoff put me into a position where I could explore a new career. TIY finally allowed me to do what I had wanted to do for many years--learn how to code. The fact that I know what I now know after only 12 weeks is astounding to me!</p>
          <p>I owe everyone at TIY St. Pete campus a tremendous amount of gratitude. My first contact was Holly, and she did a great job of explaining what the course was and was not without intimidating a novice like myself--her enthusiasm is infectious! Toni's advice is invaluable, and her patience with me (usually due to not taking her advice!) was much appreciated. Toni does so much "behind the scenes" for the students, and really deserves even more credit than she receives for it. Katherine was often my go to for reassurance about my progress--I greatly appreciate her emotional (and often technical) support through the program, as well as her advice on freelancing projects. Angel was a huge help to me pretty much every day, especially in the first half of the course. A recent TIY grad himself, he was often able to simplify concepts for me in a way that others could not--his personal contribution to my education in this course was massive. Mark excelled, for me, at keeping me grounded (for lack of a better term). I loved his energetic lecture style, and even though I did not fully grasp backend concepts the first time through, his instruction really helped me at least manage to not be completely lost. Gavin held a very important role for me personally--he introduced me to the concept of the Pomodoro Technique to quell my frustration when an assignment was going through rough patches. Though this one thing would be enough in itself, his clear, logical instructional style is excellent. I particularly enjoyed hearing about his stories from his career in aerospace. And last but certainly not least, my React.js instructor Jason was instrumental in guiding my growth as a developer. The program is tough on everyone that goes through it, but there were several moments where I particularly struggled; Jason, without fail, could pull me out of the "TIY blues", get my confidence back, and allow me to get through whatever struggle was ongoing. I am so happy that I chose to go when I did (had originally intended to attend the November cohort, which of course won't happen now), and I am glad to have both a new skillset and a new group of people I consider friends (staff and students alike). I am beyond excited to see the next iteration of this program locally, as this community needs a program like TIY, and I look forward to being involved with it in any way I can.

          <p>The Iron Yard has been the perfect start for me in preparing for a development career. The decision to go was one
            of the best decisions I have ever made. It was also hard, very very hard. And many days I wondered if I was really
            understanding everything. The answer was probably not everything right at that moment, but eventually it all
            started to click into place. Everyday since has been an exciting fast paced adventure in creating fully functional
            web applications. </p>
          <p>Thank you, Gavin, Toni, Jason, Mark, Angel, Holly, and Katherine. Without you the Iron Yard would not have had
            its personality and its welcoming and supportive spirit. Thank you Gavin for pushing me constantly, making sure
            I would get the absolute most out of my time with you as my instructor. Thank you Toni for being so in touch
            with the local businesses and making sure each one of us put our best foot forward. Thank you Jason for your
            ability to explain complicated things so well for the noobies. Thank you Mark for being such a nice person and
            so easy to talk to. Thank you Holly for being such a ray of sunshine every day and working so hard for us. Thank
            you Katherine for working so hard to get each of us everything we needed and just being you. Thank you Angel

          <p>Choosing to go to the Iron Yard is a huge decision in and of itself, and adding on moving to a new state to do so made the decision even more difficult. Without the Iron Yard and its staff, this transition would have been insanely difficult. Within weeks, I felt at home even though the street and bridge names still didn't sound familiar to me, and I owe that to the staff for helping me feel beyond welcome as a a part of Cohort 8.</p>
          <p>Gavin, Jason, Mark and Angel have become perfect examples of the type of mentor to have in both a professional and personal setting, and Toni, Holly, and Katherine have given much more purpose to my direction as a developer and a human by always being available to offer heart-warming advice. The Iron Yard has completely shaped my sense of home, and I will always consider this experience to be one of the best decisions I could have ever made.</p>

          <p>Of all the choices I have ever made, coming to the Iron Yard has to be one of the greatest choices that my brain

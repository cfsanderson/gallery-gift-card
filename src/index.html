          <p>When I first thought about going to a code school to change careers, I knew it would be hard, especially with three young children to care for. I also knew it would be worth it in the end. The Iron Yard experience turned out to be just as hard
            as I ever imagined, but also just as worth it. I accomplished what I set out to do. And really, there are few things better in life than that. Achieving a goal you've worked hard for.</p>
          <p>Thank you, Jason, Toni, and Gavin for helping me get there. The energy, passion, and dedication each of you brought to the table was remarkable and second to none. For that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and wish you nothing but the
            best in your post Iron Yard journeys.</p>

          <p>I will not lie. TIY was hard.... really hard. Initially I thought of it as an answer, but like so many things in life, it just brought up more questions and turned out to be the beginning of another long path. <strong>Fortunately, I really enjoy the path that I'm on!!!</strong></p>
          <p>Thank you Toni, Holly, Katherine, Jason, Gavin, Mark and Angel for helping me get off to a good start. I could not have chosen a finer group of people to have done it with. I am so grateful for each and every one of you and glad to call you friends. Whatever path you find yourself on next, I hope it leads to good fortune and I will be here to support you in any way I can.</p>

          <p>It may be melodramatic to say but up until attending The Iron Yard, I felt dejected in my career. My time at Iron Yard was the most challenging I've had but it has lived up to and surpassed all of my wildest dreams and expectations.</p>
          <p>All of the stafff at the Iron Yard is/was fantastic but during my time in cohort3, it was just Jason and Toni. SO, I want to say a big thank you to both of you for your support during and WELL after my time at Iron Yard. I would love the opportunity to attempt to help you as much as you have helped me.</p>

          <p>Very happy I was apart of The Iron Yard, St. Pete. It was a great experience and a wonderful place to build up the tech community for the city and bringing professionals and beginners together to create a collaborative atmosphere.</p>
          <p>A <strong>HUGE thank you</strong> to the faculty and staff that made it a home away from home during the cohort and their continuous guide and support. A truly unique group of people I can now call family, and who we can all count on for future help, connections and love.</p>

          <p>I left the military and was looking to change careers. Coupled with the fact that my brother went to The Iron Yard when he wanted to change careers, I thought this would be a good fit. I came into this with high hopes and expectations.</p>
          <p>The staff at The Iron Yard has delivered on those hopes and expectations. Learning Front-End and Back-End has been awesome! The language focus has surpassed anything that I could have hoped for. Getting your mind blown this often is probably illegal. This has been a fantastic ride and you all are the best ride operators ever!</p>

          <p>Of all the choices I have ever made, coming to the Iron Yard has to be one of the greatest choices that my brain came up with. Not one day goes by since graduating The Iron Yard have I been extremely grateful to the school for teaching me the valuable skill sets that I now know. I thank you all with the greatest love I have to give you and that is my eternal devotion. I hope that great things come to you as well.</p>
          <p>I want to thank not only my teacher, Gavin, for putting up with my constant questions and harrasment for his help, but also a big thanks to Holly for making sure that I got into the school, Toni for keeping me motivated with my career search, Katherine for all of the wonderful work that she has done to ensure that not just me but all the past, present and what was to be future students that we were essentially in a way cared for by having all the meetups scheduled and all the magic that she created. </p>

          <p>The Iron Yard has been the perfect start for me in preparing for a development career. The decision to go was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It was also hard, very very hard. And many days I wondered if I was really understanding everything. The answer was probably not everything right at that moment, but eventually it all started to click into place. Everyday since has been an exciting fast paced adventure in creating fully functional web applications. </p>
          <p>Thank you, Gavin, Toni, Jason, Mark, Angel, Holly, and Katherine. Without you the Iron Yard would not have had its personality and its welcoming and supportive spirit. Thank you Gavin for pushing me constantly, making sure I would get the absolute most out of my time with you as my instructor. Thank you Toni for being so in touch with the local businesses and making sure each one of us put our best foot forward. Thank you Jason for your ability to explain complicated things so well for the noobies. Thank you Mark for being such a nice person and so easy to talk to. Thank you Holly for being such a ray of sunshine every day and working so hard for us. Thank you Katherine for working so hard to get each of us everything we needed and just being you. Thank you Angel for being available to help out where ever needed. Thank you!</p>

          <p>Choosing to go to the Iron Yard is a huge decision in and of itself, and adding on moving to a new state to do so made the decision even more difficult. Without the Iron Yard and its staff, this transition would have been insanely difficult. Within weeks, I felt at home even though the street and bridge names still didn't sound familiar to me, and I owe that to the staff for helping me feel beyond welcome as a a part of Cohort 8.</p>
          <p>Gavin, Jason, and Mark have become perfect examples of the type of mentor to have in both a professional and personal setting, and Toni, Holly, and Katherine have given much more purpose to my direction as a developer and a human by always being available to offer heart-warming advice. The Iron Yard has completely shaped my sense of home, and I will always consider this experience to be one of the best decisions I could have ever made.</p>

          <p>After meeting Toni, interviewing with Gavin, and hearing from alumni, I knew The Iron Yard, St. Pete campus would be a great investment. Toni gets a round of applause for working so hard to make the TIY St.Pete campus a small but active tech hub. Holly and Katherine for staying late hosting meetups and preaching the good TIY gospel to the people in Tampa Bay. Gavin, Mark, and Jason for being great mentors and inspirational individuals who make you want to grow up (again?) and become dev unicorns like them. </p>
          <p>Gavin, Jason, Mark, Toni, Holly, Katherine, Thank you!!! I truly had a wonderful experience at TIY and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. May the force with be you! </p>

          <p>My time at The Iron Yard was an incredible experience that I truly can’t put it in the proper context. It was one the hardest things I’ve done in my life but one of the most gratifying. The lessons I learned at The Iron Yard I will carry with me for the rest of my life and pass it on as I advance in my new career. I knew when I took this picture on the first day on The Iron Yard, this was going to be something special.</p>
          <p>My family and I want to thank you all for being patient with me as I went through The Iron Yard. Thank you, Katherine and Holly, for the career support advice, answering all my stupid questions and having the ability to always put a smile on my face. Thank you, Angel for the sound advice and letting me drown you in D&amp;D. Thank you Toni for tirelessly working behind scenes with the community to ensure they our hard work is seen and appreciated. Thank you, Mark and Jason, for providing me with the proper guidance when I needed your help. Thank you, Gavin, for always pushing me to be a better developer, teaching me how to seek and find the answers when I was stuck on a problem and your patience for when I was at the ragged edge. Thank you for showing all of us that has walk through those doors of The Iron Yard on how we can make a positive change in our communities.</p>

          <p>One of the things I liked most about having attended The Iron Yard was the networking. I built so many great relationships between instructors, classmates and the community. Thank you, Toni, for making the students and alumni your number one priority. You did such an amazing job at being supportive and building a TIY "family". Thank you, Jason, for not only being a wonderful instructor, but also for laughing and crying with us. We all had some tough times during that cohort and it was nice that we could all be there for one another.</p>
          <p>Because I live in Sarasota I didn't get up to TIY for meetups and social events as much as I would've liked. However, there was great comfort in knowing it was there. Thanks to TIY for having provided a fun and encouraging environment for the community.</p>

          <p>Since the first day as a student The Iron Yard - Tampa-St. Petersburg I have never felt so welcomed into a "family" or a community like this. The tech community of Tampa Bay has been amazing to me and knowing that I am not losing that helps ease the hurt of losing my home away from home.</p>
          <p>TIY Tampa Bay is more than a code school, TIY Tampa Bay has become my Florida family. When I had the opportunity to become part of the staff I had no doubts that this would be the most amazing opportunity that I would never regret. If I had to do it all over again I would from the very start to the very end! I will be a part of TIY Tampa Bay until the day the doors close and I will be a part of the alumni family forever after!</p>
          <p>Thank you Antoinette Marie, Jason L Perry, Gavin Stark, Mark Dewey, Holly Valenty, and Angel Murchison for everything. I could not ask for a better group of folks to work with!</p>

          <p>Every once in a while in my life, I've gotten this funny feeling, a little tug in the pit of my stomach that tells me, "pay attention, something important is happening". It doesn't happen often and it always takes me by surprise when it does. I got that feeling the first time I walked into The Iron Yard. I knew what it meant and I decided right there to savor every moment of the following 12 weeks.</p>
          <p>I remember it all vividly. Early morning drives to St. Pete from Spring Hill and the long walk down 1st Street in the dark. Toni flipping on the lights and blinding me every morning as I sat working in the dark. The inevitable flood every time it rained and the horrible stench when they re-did the floors in the space below. Long walks at lunch to blow off steam and the first tentative steps in a friendship that would come to be so important in my life.</p>
          <p>Coding? Yeah, I learned a lot about javascript and working with git, but that isn't what I think about when I remember my time at TIY. I think mostly on the things I learned about myself and the amazing people that touched my life. I can't imagine how empty my life would be without them.</p>

          <p>It started with a what if. It started from a maybe. I’d seen people’s dream come true, and I lived with someone who was working on his dreams, someone whom was able to work on them thanks to The Iron Yard. The stories were hysterical and amazing, but I didn’t really think I would be able to do it. Then I met Holly, and we talked about all the different people who came in, and how I would be a great. Then I talked to Toni, and saw the passion. So I took a leap.</p>
          <p>Then I lost my mind, and Katherine saved me from myself, showing me the ways of the CSS master, and being a support when I needed one. I knew it would be hard, but Mark, Gavin, and Jason worked hard to make sure that we got all that we could- and tried to be careful and guiding when they saw the overload happening. </p>
          <p>I owe everything to the staff of the Iron Yard St. Pete. What Mark has taught me has been amazing, and a rollercoaster of awesome and joy. I’m so grateful for all the time they gave me, and I’m thankful for the opportunity given to me; it will make my life so much better.</p>
